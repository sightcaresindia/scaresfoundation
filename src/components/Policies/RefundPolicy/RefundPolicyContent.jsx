                        <p>At <strong>Sight Cares India Foundation</strong>, we are deeply grateful for your generous support toward our mission to uplift and empower underprivileged communities. We aim to use every donation with integrity and full accountability. This policy outlines our approach to refunds and cancellations of donations made through our website.</p>
                        <p className="mb-0"><strong>General Policy</strong></p>
                        <p>All donations made to <strong>Sight Cares India Foundation</strong> through our official website or authorized payment gateway are <strong>voluntary</strong>, <strong>non-refundable</strong>, and <strong>non-cancellable</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Once a donation is successfully processed, it <strong>cannot be cancelled, refunded, or transferred</strong> to another cause or person under any circumstances.</p>
                        <p className="mb-0"><strong>Why Refunds Are Not Allowed</strong></p>
                        <p>As a non-profit charitable organization, all donations are immediately allocated or committed to specific initiatives such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Community development</li>
                        <li>Support for visually impaired individuals</li>
                        <li>Children&rsquo;s education</li>
                        <li>Women empowerment</li>
                        <li>Health and welfare programs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Reversing funds after donation would disrupt our financial planning and hinder the impact of our social programs.</p>
                        <p className="mb-0"><strong>Technical Errors or Duplicate Transactions</strong></p>
                        <p>In rare cases where:</p>

                        <li>You have been <strong>charged twice accidentally</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Please notify us within <strong>7 days</strong> of the transaction by sharing the following details:</p>

                        <p className="mb-0"><strong>Material Support in Place of Refund</strong></p>
                        <p>In some cases, if you are unable to utilize a cooperative service (e.g., offered support or event-based participation), the donated value may instead be used to provide essential aid to the <strong>neediest visually impaired individuals</strong> or <strong>underprivileged communities</strong> &mdash; in line with our mission.
