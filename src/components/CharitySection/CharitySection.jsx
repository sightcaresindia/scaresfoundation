       <h2>Charitable Eye Hospitals & NGO Services</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="section-subtext">
      Several charitable eye hospitals and nonprofit organisations across India offer free or low-cost eye treatments, including cataract surgeries, spectacles, and medications. Hospitals conduct regular outreach camps, serving thousands of underprivileged patients each year. Many of these institutions operate mobile eye units and provide quality care regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. Patients can directly contact these hospitals or attend their local camps for screenings and further treatment.
